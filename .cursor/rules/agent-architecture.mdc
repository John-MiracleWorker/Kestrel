# agent-architecture

The agent architecture implements a sophisticated multi-component autonomous system:

1. Core Agent Systems (90/100)
- Evidence Chain: Tracks decision trails with categorized evidence nodes and relevance scoring
- Memory Graph: Semantic knowledge network with time-based decay and custom traversal
- Council System: Multi-agent debate mechanism with role-based specialists and weighted voting
- Reflection System: "Red team" critique framework with risk assessment and mitigation
- Persona Learning: Adapts to user preferences across code style, communication, workflow

2. Provider Integration Layer (85/100)
- Unified LLM provider management across OpenAI, Anthropic, Google
- Provider-specific message transformations and tool protocols
- Custom token streaming implementations per provider
- Time-based retry logic with exponential backoff

3. Multi-Channel Communication (85/100)
- Cross-platform message routing (Web, Telegram, Discord)
- Channel-specific adapters with platform capabilities
- Identity linking and deduplication across channels
- Custom notification preference system
- AI agent social network participation

4. Memory & RAG Pipeline (80/100)
- Conversation embedding with background processing
- Time-weighted relevance scoring (10% decay/week)
- Context formatting and injection
- Automatic prompt augmentation
- Workspace-scoped vector search

5. Execution Environment (85/100)
- Sandboxed skill execution with Docker isolation
- Resource limits and network controls
- Security audit logging
- Tool approval workflows
- Risk-based execution guardrails
