# agent-architecture

The agent architecture implements four key systems that enable autonomous operation:

1. Evidence Chain System (Importance: 85)
packages/brain/agent/evidence.py
- Maintains auditable decision trails for agent actions
- Records and categorizes evidence types: tool output, user input, memory
- Generates structured evidence chains with confidence scoring

2. Memory Graph Engine (Importance: 95) 
packages/brain/agent/memory_graph.py
- Semantic knowledge graph implementation for conversation memory
- Entity and relationship tracking with 10% weekly temporal decay
- Custom traversal algorithms for context retrieval
- Weight-based pruning and relevance scoring

3. Council Deliberation System (Importance: 90)
packages/brain/agent/council.py
- Multi-agent swarm debate and consensus mechanism
- Specialized agent roles: Architect, Implementer, Security Reviewer
- Voting system with confidence scoring
- Cross-critique feedback loops between agents

4. Persona Learning System (Importance: 85)
packages/brain/agent/persona.py
- Adaptive user preference learning from interactions
- Code style inference from usage patterns
- Communication style adaptation
- Temporal behavior pattern recognition

Supporting Components:

5. Task Prediction Engine (Importance: 80)
- Proactive task suggestion based on interaction patterns
- Custom temporal rules for task generation
- Stale entity detection
- Follow-up task creation logic

6. Channel Integration (Importance: 75)
- Cross-channel message routing and normalization
- User presence tracking across platforms
- Channel-specific message format handling
- Interactive component management (buttons, approvals)

7. Workspace Automation (Importance: 70)
- Cron-based automated task scheduling
- Webhook integration for external triggers
- Workflow template management
- Multi-step approval chains

The architecture emphasizes:
- Auditable decision-making
- Knowledge persistence with temporal relevance
- Multi-agent collaboration
- Adaptive personality development
- Cross-channel communication
