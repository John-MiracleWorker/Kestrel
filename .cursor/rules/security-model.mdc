description: Defines security model for workspace isolation, code execution sandboxing, and permission management for AI agent operations
---


# security-model

The security model implements a multi-layered protection system for AI agent operations:

## Tool Registry Security (Importance: 90)
Location: packages/brain/agent/tools/__init__.py
- Risk level-based access control for tool execution
- Dynamic tool filtering based on workspace permissions 
- Strict timeout enforcement with automatic termination
- Execution dispatch with comprehensive error wrapping
- Tool verification challenge system for dynamic registration

## Sandboxed Execution (Importance: 85)
Location: packages/hands/executor.py
- Docker-based skill isolation with resource quotas
- Memory/CPU/network restrictions per container
- Secure volume mounting with allowlist
- Workspace-level isolation guarantees
- Container lifecycle management with audit trails

## Workspace Security (Importance: 80)
Location: packages/hands/security/allowlist.py
- Workspace-specific security policies
- Global blocklist for dangerous operations
- Policy modes: allowlist/blocklist/hybrid
- Granular permission controls per workspace
- Cross-workspace isolation enforcement

## Security Audit System (Importance: 75)
Location: packages/hands/security/audit.py
- Detailed execution event tracking
- Resource usage monitoring
- Security violation detection
- Persistent audit logs with context
- Execution history for accountability

## Risk Management (Importance: 70)
Location: packages/brain/agent/tools/self_improve.py
- Multi-phase code analysis for security issues
- Approval workflow for sensitive operations
- Severity-based issue categorization
- Inactivity guards for auto-deployment
- Health check system with configurable thresholds
