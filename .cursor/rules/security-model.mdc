Security Architecture Components:

1. Tool Registry Access Control System
Path: packages/brain/agent/tools/__init__.py
- Risk-level based tool access filtering
- Execution lifecycle management with timeouts
- Tool capability restrictions by security requirements
Importance Score: 85

2. Sandboxed Code Execution
Path: packages/brain/agent/tools/code.py
- Isolated execution environments per language
- Resource limits and timeout enforcement
- External service boundary controls
Importance Score: 90

3. Workspace Security Model
- Strict isolation between workspaces
- Encrypted credential storage
- Access control per workspace
Importance Score: 80

4. Risk Assessment Framework
Path: packages/brain/agent/reflection.py
- Systematic "red teaming" for plan validation
- Multi-stage critique with severity levels
- Risk mitigation requirement enforcement
Importance Score: 85

5. Guardrail System
Path: packages/brain/agent/guardrails.py
- Pattern matching for dangerous operations
- Rate limiting with adaptive thresholds
- Operation approval workflows
Importance Score: 80

Key Security Patterns:
- No direct SQL access allowed
- Tool access controlled by risk level
- Mandatory workspace isolation
- Encrypted API key storage
- Sandboxed code execution
