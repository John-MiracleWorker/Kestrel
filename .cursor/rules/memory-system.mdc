# memory-system

## Core Memory Architecture (Importance Score: 90)
Two-tier memory system implementation:
1. Short-term conversation memory
- Semantic vector storage for recent interactions
- Time-weighted relevance scoring with 10% weekly decay
- Automatic conversation embedding with background processing

2. Long-term knowledge persistence
- Workspace-scoped information storage
- Vector-based similarity search for context retrieval
- Metadata-enriched embedding storage using HNSW indices

## Semantic Search Implementation (Importance Score: 85)
- Time-weighted relevance scoring algorithm for memory retrieval
- Custom decay function applied to older memories
- Context formatting and automatic prompt augmentation
- Background worker for asynchronous embedding processing

## Memory Graph System (Importance Score: 80)
- Semantic knowledge graph connecting conversation entities
- Time-based decay system for node relevance
- Entity relationship modeling specific to agent conversations 
- Custom traversal algorithm for context retrieval

## Memory Persistence (Importance Score: 75)
- Workspace isolation for memory storage
- Conversation turn processing (Q&A pairs)
- Automatic conversation embedding
- Metadata-enriched vector storage

Key Interactions:
- Memory Graph feeds contextual data to semantic search
- Short-term memory automatically transitions to long-term storage
- Time-based decay affects both tiers of memory
- Workspace scoping enforced across all memory operations
