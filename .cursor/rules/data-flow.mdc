description: Describes data flow patterns and component interactions for autonomous agent systems and tool execution pipelines

# data-flow

Primary Data Flow Paths:

1. Agent Task Execution Pipeline (Importance: 95)
- Brain service initiates task via gRPC
- Task routed through Channel Registry for workspace validation
- Tool Registry performs risk assessment and access control
- Hands service executes containerized skills with resource limits
- Results flow back through Brain for evidence chain recording
- Status updates streamed to Web UI via LiveCanvas

2. Memory Retrieval Flow (Importance: 90)
- Conversation context triggers Memory Graph traversal
- Entity relationships evaluated with temporal decay weights
- pgvector performs similarity search on embeddings
- Relevant memories merged into context window
- Memory pruning based on workspace-specific rules

3. Multi-Channel Communication (Importance: 85)
- Messages enter through channel-specific adapters
- Router applies channel identity resolution
- Deduplicator prevents duplicate processing using time windows
- Message format normalized for cross-channel compatibility
- Responses routed based on preference hierarchy:
  * same_channel
  * all_channels 
  * prefer_web

4. Model Context Protocol Flow (Importance: 80)
- Tools register capabilities with MCP server
- Tool verification challenges issued
- Session pooling manages concurrent tool access
- Results normalized through MCP client interface
- Cross-transport compatibility layer handles stdio/HTTP/SSE

5. Social Network Integration (Importance: 75)
- Agent activities logged to MoltBook feed
- Auto-verification challenges processed
- Rate limiting applied per workspace
- Activity aggregation for UI display
- Credential management with encryption

Data Store Interactions:
- PostgreSQL: User sessions, workspace data
- Redis: Rate limiting, deduplication
- pgvector: Semantic search indexes
- File system: Skill execution artifacts
