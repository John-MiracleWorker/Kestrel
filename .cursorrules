## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The codebase implements an autonomous AI agent system with several interconnected business domains:

## Core Agent Intelligence (Importance: 95)
- Memory Graph Engine (brain/agent/memory_graph.py)
  - Semantic knowledge tracking with temporal decay
  - Entity relationship management
  - Context-aware graph traversal

- Multi-Agent Council System (brain/agent/council.py)
  - Specialized agent roles (Architect, Security Reviewer)
  - Consensus-driven decision making
  - Cross-agent feedback mechanisms

## Self-Improvement Architecture (Importance: 85)
- Autonomous Code Analysis (brain/agent/tools/self_improve.py)
  - Deep architectural scanning
  - Multi-phase code review system
  - Approval workflows via Telegram
  - Auto-deployment safety controls

## Communication Management (Importance: 80)
- Cross-Channel Message Routing (gateway/src/sync/router.ts)
  - Multi-platform identity resolution
  - Channel-specific message adaptation
  - Preference-based routing strategies

## Tool Management (Importance: 75)
- Model Context Protocol System (brain/agent/tools/mcp.py)
  - Dynamic tool discovery
  - Verification challenge system
  - Session-based connection management

## Security Controls (Importance: 70)
- Sandboxed Skill Execution (hands/executor.py)
  - Containerized execution environment
  - Resource usage constraints
  - Workspace-level isolation
  - Comprehensive audit logging

## Social Integration (Importance: 65)
- Agent Social Network (brain/agent/tools/moltbook.py)
  - Auto-verification system
  - Activity feed management
  - Credential persistence
  - Rate limit handling

The system's core value proposition lies in autonomous agent capabilities with strong emphasis on safety, multi-channel communication, and self-improvement mechanisms.
